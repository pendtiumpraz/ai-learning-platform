/**
 * The `node:console` module provides a simple debugging console that is similar to
 * the JavaScript console mechanism provided by web browsers.
 *
 * The module exports two specific components:
 *
 * * A `Console` class with methods such as `console.log()`, `console.error()`, and `console.warn()` that can be used to write to any Node.js stream.
 * * A global `console` instance configured to write to [`process.stdout`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/process.html#processstdout) and
 * [`process.stderr`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/process.html#processstderr). The global `console` can be used without importing the `node:console` module.
 *
 * _**Warning**_: The global console object's methods are neither consistently
 * synchronous like the browser APIs they resemble, nor are they consistently
 * asynchronous like all other Node.js streams. See the [`note on process I/O`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/process.html#a-note-on-
